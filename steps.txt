For that exercise, you’re form will ask a user for an item to look up. I recommend keeping it simple and starting with just the airline name.
Then, you take the name the user wants to search for and search for that in the JSON array you get back form the API.
Using the filter() method is what I recommend to filter the array down to just the airline the user is searching for.
Once you have it working with airline you can try adding other items to the form and doing more complex, or additional, searches.

Your form is already correctly setup, you just need to simplify it a bit so you don’t have to fill out every field.
Then, take the value from the form and use it to filter the API response, and return those values to the browser by adding them to the DOM.
